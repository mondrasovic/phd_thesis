\label{chap:Methodology}

In this chapter, we describe our scientific constributions. We start off with our attempts that did not manifest into primary advances in the field of object tracking per set, yet they were significant enough that they earned a journal publication in the end. Subsequently, we dive into our contributions to the field of Siamese-based \gls{vot}, which is the primary goal of this dissertation thesis.
