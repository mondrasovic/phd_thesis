\section{Siamese Multi-Object Tracking}
\label{sec:SiamMOT}

This section is dedicated to the most important tracker we have encountered during our research, called \modelname{SiamMOT}~\cite{shuai2021siammot}. Its importance stems from the fact that the majority of our experiments adopted this model. Even though this section could be part of the theoretical foundations chapter, we found it more comprehensible to provide the description of the base architecture closer to the description of our methods and experiments.

\subsection{General Description}

The authors of~\cite{shuai2021siammot} tracker focused on improving online \gls{mot}. As far as their methodology was concerned, they employed region-based approach~\cite{Ren2017} in conjunction with a Siamese multi-object tracking network, hence the name \modelname{SiamMOT}. Broadly speaking, this architecture employes Siamese tracker for motion estimation between two frames. We would like to note that all the principles so far discussed regarding Siamese trackers apply here. However, as already suggested, the adoption of \gls{rpn} enables this framework to have more information available. Not only there is the motion prediction from the Siamese tracker, there are also detections produced by the \modelname{Faster R-CNN} object detector~\cite{Ren2017} that is integrated within the whole architecture. Subsequently, an online solver is utilized to merge these prediction obtained from the tracker and detector heads. It is no surprise that such a framework that exploits modern approaches (more on that later) to object detection and Siamese tracking produces \gls{sota} performance.

We will disect this framewrok in great detail since we studied it scrupulously. We performed multiple experiments, many of which did not yield expected improvements. Nevertheless, the practical part of our work was focused on contributing to the open source repository dedicated to this project developed by several Amazon researchers~\cite{siammotoriggithub}. We followed a standard path of how contributing to open source projects should be done in a transparent and, more importantly, compatible fashion. We initialized a fresh fork of this project on our personal GitHub account~\cite{siammotforkgithub} to preserve as much compatibility with the original software as possible and to not strip ourselves of the opportunity to easily receive potential updates from the original repository.

During our development we often engaged in discussions related to this project incentivized by other researchers who were also working on this project and trying to either only apply this work to their specific use case or even extend the model. Our detailed knowledge of this model acquired through deliberate and long-lasting work on this project often helped several other programmers who dealt with various issues. From the programming standpoint, our work involved a considerable amount of programming, even though the base architecture was provided and fully functional. We would like to emphasize that the project consisted of $?$ lines of source code programmed purely in Python programming language. Concerning the deep learning aspect, the PyTorch library~\cite{NEURIPS2019_9015} was primarily used. It is a widely known library aimed at building deep neural network models while exploiting automatic differentiation.

\subsection{Model Architecture}

The two key aspects of the the \modelname{SiamMOT} architecture are \modelname{Faster R-CNN}~\cite{Ren2017} object detector and Siamese tracker. The salient element of the \modelname{Faster R-CNN} is the \gls{rpn}. Simply put, \modelname{SiamMOT} adds a region-based Siamese tracker along the standard $2$-stage object detection pipeline in order to model instance-level motion.

As depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:SiamMOTArchitecture}, the input consists of two frames, namely $\mtxsup{I}{t}$ and $\mtxsup{I}{t + \delta}$, accompanied by a set of detected object instances $\mtxsup{R}{t} = \cbrackets{\subsup{R}{1}{t}, \subsup{R}{2}{t}, \dots, \subsup{R}{i}{t}, \dots}$ at time $t$. During the inference process, the detection head produces a set of detected object instances $\mtxsup{R}{t + \delta}$ whilst the tracker's task is to propage the detections $\mtxsup{R}{t}$ to time $t + \delta$, and thus yielding the tracker output denoted as $\mtxsup{\tilde{R}}{t + \delta}$. Please note that it is not the output of the entire tracker, only of the Siamese tracker itself. These instances have to be further processed. Explained next.

This framework relies on a motion model that \emph{tracks} each detected object instance from time $t$ to $t + \delta$. A specific \gls{bbox} $\subsup{R}{i}{t}$ at time $t$ is thus propagated to its future counterpart $\subsup{\tilde{R}}{i}{t + \delta}$ at time $t + \delta$. Such a procedure is then completed by a spatial matching process the objective of which is the \emph{association} of the tracker output $\subsup{\tilde{R}}{i}{t + \delta}$ with detections $\subsup{\tilde{R}}{i}{t + \delta}$ at time $t + \delta$ such that detected instances are linked from $t$ to $t + \delta$.

Assume there is a specific object instance $i$ detected at time $t$. Then, the Siamese tracker searches for this particular instance at frame $\mtxsup{I}{t + \delta}$ while exploiting a contextual window spanning a fixed neighborhood of the object's location (i.e., $\subsup{R}{i}{t}$) at frame $\mtxsup{I}{t}$. In order to define this step more formally, consider the following dependency:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:SiamMOTSiameseTracker}
    \rbrackets{
        \subsup{v}{i}{t + \delta},
        \subsup{\tilde{R}}{i}{t + \delta}
    } =
    \func{\mathcal{T}}{
        \mtxsubsup{f}{R_i}{t}, \mtxsubsup{f}{S_i}{t + \delta}; \Theta
    },
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{T}$ is a module (head) represented by the Siamese tracker with learnable parameters $\Theta$. In light of the already stated efficiency of this framework in terms reusing information as much as possible, the module $\mathcal{T}$ is trained on shared feature maps extracted from the backbone using \gls{roi}-align operations. As a short reminder, a basic Siamese tracker uses an exemplar image encoded as a kernel to search for the occurrence of the corresponding object in a future frame over a specific search region that should be, by definition, greater than the exemplar region. Thus, the feature map $\mtxsubsup{f}{R_i}{t}$ is extracted over the region $\subsup{R}{i}{t}$ contained in the frame $\mtxsup{I}{t}$. Analogically, the feature map $\mtxsubsup{f}{S_i}{t + \delta}$ is extracted over the search region $\subsup{S}{i}{t + \delta}$ delineated in the frame $\mtxsup{I}{t + \delta}$. The region $\subsup{S}{i}{t + \delta}$ is computed by simple expansion of the region $\subsup{R}{i}{t}$ by a factor $r$, such that $r > 1$, while preserving the location of the geometric center, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:SiamMOTArchitecture} by the dashed \gls{bbox}. Once again, a standard procedure of region expansion while maintaining the original region in the center of the specified region that is ubiquitous among single-object Siamese trackers. Last but not least, $\subsup{v}{i}{t + \delta}$ represents the visibility confidence for the detected instance $i$ at time $t + \delta$. This visibility score reflects the tracker's prediction confidence, and so the value $\subsup{v}{i}{t + \delta}$ should be high if the instance is visible in $\subsup{S}{i}{t + \delta}$, otherwise the value should be low. On top of this formulation that is reminiscent of single object tracking, in the \gls{mot} context the equation~\ref{eq:SiamMOTSiameseTracker} is applied multiple times, i.e., for each object detected in frame $t$, signified by $\subsup{R}{i}{t} \in \mtxsup{R}{t}$. However, from implementation's perspective, all these operations can run in parallel and thus the backbone features are computed only once, making the online tracking inference very efficient.

    \caption[\modelname{SiamMOT} architecture]{The base architecture of the \modelname{SiamMOT} model. This tracker detects and associates object instances simultaneously. The Siamese tracker situated in the top branch serves the purpose of predicting motion of objects across frames, thus faciliates temporal linking of objects in an online fashion. Simply put, the Siamese tracker module can be thought of as a single object tracker with all the pros and cons we have discussed so far. On the other hand, a $2$-stage object detection is performed as part of the bottom branch. These two branches are then merged using a solver that spatially and temporally attemps to match tracker and detector predictions to produce the tracker output. We have to emphasize that the spatial matching and solver blocks are only used during the inference and are not differentiable. Note that the feature map corresponding to the frame $\mtxsup{I}{t}$ is shrunk to $\nicefrac{1}{2}$ of its actual size to fit the figure. Backbone features are identical in terms of tensor shapes for both inputs. \externalsrc{\cite{shuai2021siammot}}}

The authors conjectured that motion modeling is of paramount importance for online \gls{mot}. Given our experience in this field so far, we agree. The motion modeling is practically reponsible for association between $\mtxsup{R}{t}$ and $\mtxsup{R}{t + \delta}$. Despite its efficacy, there are still issues to be addressed. The association will fail due to the following reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item if $\mtxsup{\tilde{R}}{t + \delta}$ does not match to the correct object instance in $\mtxsup{R}{t + \delta}$,
    \item or if $\subsup{v}{i}{t + \delta}$ is low (below a specific threshold) for a visible object (person, vehicle, etc.) at time $t + \delta$.
\end{enumerate}
In order to tackle the problems outlined above, the Siamese tracker exploits various \gls{sota} techniques developed in the single-object Siamese tracking community. We affirmatively approve of the authors decisions, since we deliberately elaborated on multiple aspects that this tracker heavily relies upon in our survey on Siamese tracking~\cite{Ondrasovic2021Siamese}.

As far as the Siamese part of the \modelname{SiamMOT} is concerned, the authors dubbed their technique as ``explicit motion modeling''. They also worked with ``implicit motion modeling'', but that branch of experiments was neither sufficiently expanded in the paper nor it is of particular importance for our research due to its inferior performance. It only servered the purpose of having a baseline to overcome during evaluation.

\subsubsection{Explicit Motion Modeling}

The most fundamental aspect of Siamese trackers is the cross-correlation operator (Section~\ref{}) to generate a pixel-level $2$D response map. In \modelname{SiamMOT}, this operation correlation each location of the search feature map (belonging to the search region) $\mtxsubsup{f}{S_i}{t + \delta}$ with the exemplar (target) feature map $\mtxsubsup{f}{R_i}{t}$ to produce a response map
\begin{equation}
    \mtxsub{r}{i} = \mtxsubsup{f}{S_i}{t + \delta} \star \mtxsubsup{f}{R_i}{t}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, each map $r_i$ captures a different aspect of similarity at every pixel.

Inspired by the \gls{fcos} visual object detector, this tracker adopts fully-convolutional network $\psi$ to facilitate instance detection using the response map $\mtxsub{r}{i}$. Besides, the so-called ``centerness'' is also utilized in this architecture (discussed later). The network $\psi$ enables a prediction of a dense visibility confidence map $\mtxsub{v}{i}$. Every pixel of $\mtxsub{v}{i}$ is used as an indicator of the likelihood that this pixels falls within the location of the target object. Besides, a dense location map $\mtxsub{p}{i}$ is also predicted with the goal of encoding offsets from that particular location to the top-left and bottom right \gls{bbox} corners. Consequently, the instance region at $\rbrackets{x, y}$ can be derived by the transformation
\begin{equation}
    \func{\mathcal{R}}{\func{\mtx{p}}{x, y}} =
    \sbrackets{x - l, y - t, x + r, y + b},
\end{equation}
where $\func{\mtx{p}}{x, y} = \sbrackets{l, t, r, b}$, i.e., individual corner offsets. This map is then decoded as
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        &\subsup{\tilde{R}}{i}{t + \delta} =
        \func{\mathcal{R}}{\func{\mtxsub{p}{i}}{x^*, y^*}}\\
        &\subsup{v}{i}{t + \delta} = \func{\mtxsub{v}{i}}{x^*, y^*}\\
        \text{s. t. } \quad &\rbrackets{x^*, y^*} = \underset{x, y}{\text{argmax}} \rbrackets{\mtxsub{v}{i} \odot \mtxsub{\eta}{i}},
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
in which $\odot$ symbolizes the element-wise multiplication, $\mtxsub{\eta}{i}$ incurs a non-negative penalty score throughout the entire candidate region computed as
\begin{equation}
    \func{\mtxsub{\eta}{i}}{x, y} =
    \lambda \mathcal{C} +
    \rbrackets{1 - \lambda} \func{\mathcal{S}}{
        \func{\mathcal{R}}{
            \func{\mtx{p}}{x, y}
        },
        \subsup{R}{i}{t}
    }.
\end{equation}
Here, the letter $\lambda$, such that $0 \leq \lambda \leq 1$, is a weighting coefficient, $\mathcal{C}$ is the cosine-window function (Section~\ref{}) with respect to the geometric center of the previous target location given by $\subsup{R}{i}{t}$, and $\mathcal{S}$ is a Gaussian function that is supposed to penalize the height-to-width ratio changes between candidate region $\func{\mtx{p}}{x, y}$ and $\subsup{R}{i}{t}$. The aim of the penalty map is to discourage abrupt changes in target location between individual frames during the course of tracking. This technique is widely adopted in Siamese trackers.

\subsubsection{Loss Function}

The loss function for this model consists of multiple parts and for its completeness it requires a triplet $\rbrackets{\subsup{R}{i}{t}, \subsup{S}{i}{t + \delta}, \subsup{R}{i}{t + \delta}}$. The following function is minimized during the training phase:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \lossf =
    &\sum_{\forall \rbrackets{x, y}}
    \func{l_{\text{focal}}}{
        \func{\mtxsub{v}{i}}{
            x, y
        },
        \func{\mtxsubsup{v}{i}{*}}{
            x, y
        }
    } +\\
    &\sum_{\forall \rbrackets{x, y}}
    \mathbbm{1}
    \sbrackets{
        \func{\mtxsubsup{v}{i}{*}}{
            x, y
        } = 1
    }
    \rbrackets{
        \func{w}{x, y}
        \cdot
        \func{l_{\text{reg}}}{
            \func{\mtxsub{p}{i}}{x, y},
            \func{\mtxsubsup{p}{i}{*}}{x, y}
        }
    }
    \end{aligned}.
\end{equation}
In the expression above, the pairs $\rbrackets{x, y}$ enumerate all valid position within the $\subsup{S}{i}{t + \delta}$ region. The loss function dedicated to regression task, i.e., $l_{\text{reg}}$, is formulated as the \gls{iou} loss for regression~\cite{danelljan2019atom, Yu2016UnitBox}. To address the class-balance problem in an effective way, the focal loss for classification~\cite{lin2018focal} given by the term $l_{\text{focal}}$ is employed, too.

Two two aforementioned heads function on top of backbone features through the lens of \gls{roi} align operations. During the inference phase, the ``online solver'' works only with the final \glspl{bbox} produced by the tracker and the object detector.
