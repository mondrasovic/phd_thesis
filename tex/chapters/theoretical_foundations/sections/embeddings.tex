\subsection{Learning Metric Embedding}
\label{ssec:LearningMetricEmbedding}

As~\cite{hermans2017triplet} describes the goal of learning metric embedding is to learn a function $\func{f_\theta}{x}: \mathbb{R}^F \to \mathbb{R}^D$, which maps semantically similar points from the data manifold in $\mathbb{R}^F$ onto metrically close points in $\mathbb{R}^D$. Analogously, $\func{f_\theta}{\cdot}$ should map semantically different points in $\mathbb{R}^F$ onto metrically distant points in $\mathbb{R}^D$. The function $\func{f_\theta}{\cdot}$ ideally maps \emph{similar} (a measure of similarity has to be defined, as in \sectiontext{}~\ref{ssec:EmbeddingVectorSimilarity}) points in the input space to nearby points on the manifold~\cite{hadsell2006dimreduction}.

Suppose the use of this transformation for vehicle \gls{reid}. This embedding would be achieved by a learned function that would map the images of vehicles into a latent space, where images of the same vehicle would be mapped closer together. Moreover, such mapping should be invariant to variations in lighting conditions, vehicle rotations, and many others. Among other things, embedding trained this way can be used to produce a feature vector for classification, one-shot learning tasks~\cite{koch2015siameseoneshot}, clustering~\cite{schroff2015facenet}, face recognition~\cite{parkhi2015deepface} and last, but not least, \gls{reid}~\cite{kuma2019vehiclereid}.

\subsection{Embedding Vector Similarity}
\label{ssec:EmbeddingVectorSimilarity}

There are various ways to evaluate the degree of similarity between embedding vectors. For simplicity as well as our purposes, we will discuss the two most common approaches, \ietext{}, Euclidean distance and cosine similarity.

Let $\vect{u}$ and $\vect{v}$ be arbitrary $D$-dimensional vectors representing our embedding vectors. The Euclidean distance between the vectord $\vect{u}$ and $\vect{v}$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:EuclideanDistance}
    \euclnorm{\vect{u} - \vect{v}} =
    \sqrt{
        \sum_{i = 0}^{D} \rbrackets{\vect{u}_i - \vect{v}_i}^2
    },
\end{equation}
and the cosine similarity is defined as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:CosineSimilarity}
    \func{\cos \angle}{\vect{u}, \vect{v}} =
    \func{\cos}{\theta} =
    \frac{
        \vect{u} \cdot \vect{v}
    }{
        \euclnorm{\vect{u}} \euclnorm{\vect{v}}
    },
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors $\vect{u}$ and $\vect{v}$.

The major distinction between these measures is that cosine similarity only measures the angular difference between the vectors regardless of their magnitude, whereas the Euclidean distance takes the vector length into account as it quantifies the distance between the ``tips'' of the vectors. However, one important property is that as long as the two vectors under consideration are normalized, \ietext{}, they are of unit length, then the squared Euclidean distance is proportional to the cosine similarity as given by
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:CosineEuclideanRelation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \euclnorm{
            \frac{\vect{u}}{\euclnorm{\vect{u}}} -
            \frac{\vect{v}}{\euclnorm{\vect{v}}}
        }^2 =
        2 -
        2 \frac{
            \vect{u} \cdot \vect{v}
        }{
            \euclnorm{\vect{u}} \euclnorm{\vect{v}}
        } =
        2 - 2 \func{\cos \angle}{\vect{u}, \vect{v}}
        \in \left< 0, 4 \right>.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

For the upcoming discussion, let $\func{D}{x, y}: \mathbb{R}^D \times \mathbb{R}^D \to \mathbb{R}$ be a metric function measuring distances in the embedding space. Without a loss of generality, we resort to use of the Euclidean distance ($L_2$ norm), so $\func{D}{x, y} = \euclnorm{x - y}$.

\subsubsection{Contrastive Loss}

Consider a sample $\rbrackets{x_0, x_1, y}$, where $x_0$ and $x_1$ represent the input, and the label $y = 1$ if $x_0$ and $x_1$ belong to the same category, otherwise $y = 0$. $\func{D}{\cdot}$ is the previously defined metric function, and $\alpha$ is the margin representing the minimum distance in the metric space to separate positive from negative samples. Then the contrastive function for any sample is defined as~\cite{hadsell2006dimreduction}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ContrastiveLoss}
    \func{\mathcal{L}_{contr}}{\theta} =
    \frac{1}{2}y
    {\func{D}{\func{f_\theta}{x_0}, \func{f_\theta}{x_1}}}^2 +
    \frac{1}{2}
    \rbrackets{1 - y} {\rbrackets{
            \sbrackets{\alpha - \func{D}{\func{f_\theta}{x_0}, \func{f_\theta}{x_1}}}_{+}}}^2.
\end{equation}
The two inputs $x_0$ and $x_1$ are fed to the shared model at the same time. The output is then evaluated by the contrastive loss function (\figtext{}~\ref{fig:SiameseAndTripletArchitectures} \imgpartdesc{a}). Positive samples should have a small distance between each other as measured by the $\func{D}{\cdot}$ to decrease the loss towards $0$. On the other hand, negative samples should have a distance beyond the threshold $\alpha$ to incur a loss of $0$.

\subsubsection{Triplet Loss}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{figure}[t]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/theoretical_foundations/triplet_loss_model_structure.pdf}}
    \caption[Triplet loss architecture]{A model structure developed by~\cite{schroff2015facenet}. This network consists of a batch input layer and a deep \gls{cnn} followed by an $L_2$ normalization, which produces the final embedding. A triplet loss is used during the training. \externalsrc{\cite{schroff2015facenet}}}
    \label{fig:TripletLossModelStructure}
\end{figure}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apart from the contrastive loss, this time three samples are required to compute the loss. The rationale is to supply additional context when forming the metric space. Siamese networks are usually implemented using shared model weights, but there are better approaches when the triplet loss is used. Conceptually speaking, the model could be implemented as shown in \figtext{}~\ref{fig:SiameseAndTripletArchitectures} \imgpartdesc{b}. However, as we will discuss later, triplet mining strategies are required for the triplet loss to work properly. The model can be thus simplified from an architectural point of view at the cost of moving the complexity to the computation of the loss function (see \figtext{}~\ref{fig:TripletLossModelStructure}).

Let $N$ be the number of all possible valid triplets $\rbrackets{x_a^i, x_p^i, x_n^i}$ for a given dataset. For any $i$-th triplet, let $x_a^i$ be the \emph{anchor} for a specific object (person, vehicle, etc.) with label $\func{y}{x_a^i}$, $x_p^i$ be the positive sample of the same object with label $\func{y}{x_p^i}$, such that $x_a^i \neq x_p^i \land \func{y}{x_a^i} = \func{y}{x_p^i}$, and let $x_n^i$ with label $\func{y}{x_n^i}$ be a sample of any other object, satisfying $\func{y}{x_a^i} \neq \func{y}{x_n^i}$, $\forall i = 1, \dots, N$. Let $\alpha$ be the margin value that is enforced between positive and negative pairs. Then, we want the relationship
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:TripletDistanceConstraint}
    \func{D}{\func{f_\theta}{x_a^i}, \func{f_\theta}{x_p^i}} + \alpha < \func{D}{\func{f_\theta}{x_a^i}, \func{f_\theta}{x_n^i}}, \forall i = 1, \dots, N,
\end{equation}
to hold true. The triplet loss function is therefore defined as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:TripletLoss}
    \func{\mathcal{L}_{triplet}}{\theta} =
    \sum_{i = 1}^{N}
    {\sbrackets{
        \alpha +
        \func{D}{\func{f_\theta}{x_a^i}, \func{f_\theta}{x_p^i}} -
        \func{D}{\func{f_\theta}{x_a^i}, \func{f_\theta}{x_n^i}}
    }}_+.
\end{equation}
During the training using the triplet loss, the model should learn to push negative samples further away from the positive samples, ideally exceeding the margin $\alpha$. Assuming a situation when the negative sample is mapped closer than a positive sample, the training should result in the desired situation of bringing the positive sample closer while pushing the negative one further (see \figtext{}~\ref{fig:TripletLossLearningProcess}).

    \caption[Triplet loss learning]{The objective is to learn embeddings such that the anchor is closer to the positive example than it is to the negative example by some specified margin value. The triplet loss, therefore, minimizes the distance between the anchor and the positive sample of the same identity and maximizes the distance between the anchor and the negative sample of a different identity. \externalsrc{\cite{schroff2015facenet}}}

\subsection{Triplet Mining Strategies}
\label{ssec:TripletMiningStrategies}

Contrastive (\eqtext{}~\ref{eq:ContrastiveLoss}) and triplet (\eqtext{}~\ref{eq:TripletLoss}) loss functions play an important role in training an embedding model. However, the way that pairs or triplets are selected is crucial, and as Hermans~\etal{}~\cite{hermans2017triplet} and Manmatha~\etal{}~\cite{manmatha2017samplingmatters} showed, it may significantly influence the training. The sampling strategy matters at least as much as the loss function itself. Moreover, as the dataset gets larger, then the number of possible triplets grows cubically, rendering the use of all of them impractical. The majority of those triplets would be so-called \emph{easy triplets}, thus hindering the learning process, because generating all possible triplets produces many triplets that fulfill the constraint in \eqtext{}~\ref{eq:TripletDistanceConstraint}. To paraphrase the analogy from~\cite{hermans2017triplet}, showing the model that people with different clothes are not the same person after a certain point does not bring any new information. On the other hand, explicitly \emph{mining} images of similar-looking yet different people with the same clothes (\emph{hard negatives}) or of the same person with dramatically different poses (\emph{hard positives}) vastly contributes to an understanding of the notion of the \emph{same person}. As suggested, there are different kinds of triplets which are defined in \tabletext{}~\ref{tab:TripletCategoriesDefinitions}, using a general $\rbrackets{x_a^i, x_p^i, x_n^i}$ triplet for clarity. We encourage the reader to observe \figtext{}~\ref{fig:PositiveAndNegativeTripletsCategories}, too.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to attain an effective convergence during the training, it is necessary to select triplets that violate the triplet constraint in \eqtext{}~\ref{eq:TripletDistanceConstraint}. This means that given $x_a^i$, the goal is to select a \emph{hard positive} $x_p^i$ given by $\argmax_{x_p^i}\cbrackets{\func{D}{\func{f_\theta}{x_a^i}, \func{f_\theta}{x_p^i}}}$ and a \emph{hard negative} $x_n^i$ as a result of $\argmin_{x_n^i}\cbrackets{\func{D}{\func{f_\theta}{x_a^i}, \func{f_\theta}{x_n^i}}}$. Admittedly, it is often infeasible to compute the $\argmin\cbrackets{\cdot}$ and $\argmax\cbrackets{\cdot}$ over the entire training set. In this regard, there are two possible approaches to tackle this problem, either by selecting these hard triplets online or doing it offline~\cite{schroff2015facenet}.

\subsubsection{Offline Triplet Mining}

Given a training set, the task is to produce reasonable triplets off-line, for instance, at the epoch beginning. First, a list of $N$ different valid triplets is randomly generated, then separated into $\lfloor \nicefrac{N}{B} \rfloor$ batches of $B$ triplets, followed by computation of $3N$ embeddings using the most recent network checkpoint. Each sample in a batch consists of a triplet, so the embeddings have to be computed three times. Subsequently, hard or semi-hard triplets may be selected. Since this strategy has been shown on multiple occasions~\cite{schroff2015facenet, hermans2017triplet, kuma2019vehiclereid} as an inferior choice compared to the online triplet mining, we will not discuss this approach further.

\subsubsection{Online Triplet Mining}

Online mining is performed by selecting the hard positive/negative exemplars from within a mini-batch (\figtext{}~\ref{fig:TripletArchitectureOnlineMining}). A condition that a minimum number of exemplars for any identity is present in each mini-batch has to be met. For example, Schroff~\etal{}~\cite{schroff2015facenet} used $40$ different images of a single person (an identity) per mini-batch. Let $P$ be the number of different objects/identities (\egtext{}, people, vehicles) and $K$ be the number of different images for a concrete identity (\egtext{} different views of the same vehicle). There are two prominent approaches to online mining: \emph{batch all} and \emph{batch hard}.

    \label{fig:TripletArchitectureOnlineMining}
\end{figure}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Online Triplet Mining: Batch All}

This strategy aims for selecting all valid triplets and averaging the loss only on the hard and semi-hard triplets. Easy triplets, \ietext{}, those for which the loss function equals $0$), are not taken into account. The reason is that averaging on them would result in a very small loss, since they would usually vastly outnumber the set of harder triplets~\cite{hermans2017triplet}. This approach produces a total of $PK \rbrackets{K - 1} \rbrackets{PK - K}$ triplets ($PK$ anchors, $K - 1$ positives per anchors, $PK - K$ negatives) incorporated in the loss function as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:BatchAllLossFunction}
    \begin{aligned}
        \func{\mathcal{L}_{batchall}}{\theta} =
        \sum_{i = 1}^P
        \sum_{a = 1}^K
        \sum_{\substack{p = 1 \\p \neq a}}^K
        \sum_{\substack{j = 1 \\j \neq i}}^P
        \sum_{n = 1}^K
        \Bigg[
         & \alpha +           \\
         & \func{D}{
            \func{f_\theta}{x_a^i},
            \func{f_\theta}{x_p^i}
        } -                   \\
         & \func{D}{
            \func{f_\theta}{x_a^i},
            \func{f_\theta}{x_n^j}
        }
        {\Bigg]}_{+}.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Online Triplet Mining: Batch Hard}

In this strategy, the goal is to find the hardest positive and hardest negative for each anchor. The total number of triplets is $PK$. The selected triplets are the hardest among the given batch. Additionally, Hermans~\etal{}~\cite{hermans2017triplet} say that the selected triplets can be considered moderate since they are the hardest within a small subset of the data, which is the best for learning with the triplet loss.
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:BatchHardMining}
    \begin{aligned}
        \func{\mathcal{L}_{batchhard}}{\theta} =
        \sum_{i = 1}^P
        \sum_{a = 1}^K
        \Bigg[
         & \alpha +                            \\
         & \underset{p = 1, \dots, K} {\max}

            \func{D}{
                \func{f_\theta}{x_a^i},
                \func{f_\theta}{x_p^i}
            }
        } -                                    \\
         & \underset{\substack{j = 1, \dots, P \\n = 1, \dots, K\\j \neq i}} {\min}

            \func{D}{
                \func{f_\theta}{x_a^i},

            }
        }
