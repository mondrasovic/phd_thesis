\chapter{Developed Homography Ranking Method}
\label{chap:HomographyRanking}

This chapter is dedicated to one of our experiments that were not completely related to the \gls{vot} itself, yet we achieved an original scientific contribution that could potentially be applied to object tracking. Even though we did not continue with the homography-based object tracking due to limitations of available datasets, still we would like to elaborate on our developed approach. The proposed method was fully described as well as scrupulously tested under difficult conditions. The write-up of the whole research process was eventually published in a journal~\cite{ondrasovic2021homography}, building on top of a conference article~\cite{ondrasovic2020foundations}.
