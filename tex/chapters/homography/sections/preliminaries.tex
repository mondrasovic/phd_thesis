\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:HomographyPreliminaries}

This section contains a description of our custom terminology. Despite the existence of standard conventions for naming certain aspects of our problem, we nevertheless had to coin a few more terms for clarity.

We define a marker as an object with a known, easy-to-detect shape. Such object can be either naturally occurring or artificially placed on the planar surface of the scene we want to remove perspective distortion from, i.e., to produce a bird's-eye view. The marker contains keypoints, which is a set of distinct, independent, visual feature points (for instance, corners). The chosen keypoints visible in the perspectively deformed image are called the \mbox{warped keypoints}. The set of the \mbox{rectified keypoints} is represented in the desired image (not subjected to perspective distortion) and is produced from the warped keypoints using the homography projection. Last but not least, the \mbox{point correspondence} is a relationship between the warped and the \mbox{target keypoints} and it is necessary for homography estimation. In an ideal case, the rectified keypoints match the target keypoints in terms of their pixel positions (see \figstr{}~\ref{fig:HomographyTerminology}).

Unless stated otherwise, a \mbox{\textbf{similarity transformation}} denotes a limited affine transformation with $4$ DoF which encompasses translation, rotation and uniform scaling (equation \ref{eq:SimilarityMatrices}). Specifically, let $\mset{K}_1$ and $\mset{K}_2$ be sets of feature keypoints belonging to objects $O_1$ and $O_2$. We refer to the objects $O_1$ and $O_2$ as \mbox{\textbf{similar}} if there exists a similarity transformation $\psi$, such that $\mset{K}_1 = \func{\psi}{\mset{K}_2}$ and $\mset{K}_2 = \func{\psi^{-1}}{\mset{K}_1}$. For instance, $O_1$ and $O_2$ may represent rectangles of different sizes whilst having a equal aspect ratio.

Let $m$ denote the number of markers and $k$ represent the number of keypoints belonging to each marker in consideration. We describe each $i$-th marker using a $3 \times k$ matrix $\suprbrackets{\mtx{W}}{i}$ that stores the warped keypoints as
\begin{equation}
    \suprbrackets{\mtx{W}}{i} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \subsuprbrackets{x}{1}{i} & \subsuprbrackets{x}{2}{i} & \dots & \subsuprbrackets{x}{k}{i} \\
        \subsuprbrackets{y}{1}{i} & \subsuprbrackets{y}{2}{i} & \dots & \subsuprbrackets{y}{k}{i} \\
        1                         & 1                         & \dots & 1
    \end{bmatrix},
    i = 1, \dots, m.
\end{equation}
Analogivally, we describe the target keypoints using a $3 \times k$ matrix $\mtx{T}$. Owing to the many-to-one point correspondence, only one specification is sufficient. Just beware that the ordering of keypoints had to match the warped keypoints defined above, so
\begin{equation}
    \mtx{T} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \tilde{x}_1 & \tilde{x}_2 & \dots & \tilde{x}_k \\
        \tilde{y}_1 & \tilde{y}_2 & \dots & \tilde{y}_k \\
        1           & 1           & \dots & 1
    \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
with the point correspondence relationship formulated as
\begin{equation}
    \subsuprbrackets{x}{j}{i} \simeq \tilde{x}_j, \subsuprbrackets{y}{j}{i} \simeq \tilde{y}_j, i = 1, \dots, m, j = 1, \dots, k.
\end{equation}
