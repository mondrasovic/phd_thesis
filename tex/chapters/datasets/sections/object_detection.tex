\subsection{MS-COCO}
\label{ssec:DatasetMSCOCO}

The \mscoco{} dataset~\cite{lin2014mscoco} was created for object segmentation purposes. However, if a model solves a more complicated problem of object segmentation, pure object detection is considerably easier. To this end, this dataset is often adopted for training object detectors. It is considered a benchmark dataset in different academic and industrial research areas. The images in the dataset are everyday objects. In total, there are over $200\ 000$ labeled images, $1.5$ million of object instances encompassing $80$ object categories (``person'', ``car'', ``chair'', etc.). There are additional annotations unrelated to our purposes.
