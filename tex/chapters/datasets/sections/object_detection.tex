\subsection{MS-COCO}
\label{ssec:DatasetMSCOCO}

The \mscoco{} dataset~\cite{lin2014mscoco} was created for the purpose of object segmentation. However, if a model solves a much more complicated problem of object segmentation, pure object detection is then just one of many steps. To this end, this dataset is often adopted for training object detectors. It is a widely used dataset for image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. It is considered a benchmark dataset in different academic and industrial research areas. The images in the dataset are everyday objects.

\subsection{CrowdHuman}
\label{ssec:DatasetCrowdHuman}

This dataset~\cite{shao2018crowdhuman} is a well-known benchmark for detecting humans in a crowd, providing a large amount of data with rich annotations of high diversity. It consists of $15\ 000$, $4\ 370$ and $5\ 000$ images for training, validation, and testing, respectively.
