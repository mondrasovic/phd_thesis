\chapter{Developed Approaches to Visual Object Tracking}
\label{chap:DevelopedVisualTrackingApproaches}

In this chapter, we dive into our contributions to the field of Siamese-based \gls{vot}. Every section in this chapter follows more-or-less the same pattern. Every section begins with motivation, then elaborates on some particular solution, and finishes off by providing an experimental evaluation with a corresponding discussion. We start by commenting on why we think the most important tracker, \gls{siammot} framework, was chosen as a base for our experimentation, and then proceed to a general description of this approach (\sectiontext{}~\ref{sec:SiamMOT}). Subsequently, we propose our first enhancement to this tracker based on top of external neural network used for object \gls{reid} (\sectiontext{}~\ref{sec:SiamMOTandReID}). In the following section, we describe our experiments aimed at incorporating learning metric embeddings into end-to-end training pipeline of the \gls{siammot} tracker itself (\sectiontext{}~\ref{sec:SiamMOTandFeatureEmb}). We close the chapter by examining the inclusion of the attention mechanism and a deformable convolution operation, once again, by altering the end-to-end tracking pipeline (\sectiontext{}~\ref{sec:SiamMOTandAttention}).
