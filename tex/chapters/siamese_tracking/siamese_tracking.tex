\chapter{Developed Approaches to Visual Object Tracking}
\label{chap:DevelopedVisualTrackingApproaches}

In this chapter, we dive into our contributions to the field of Siamese-based \gls{vot}. Each section in this chapter follows more-or-less the same pattern. It begins with motivation, elaborates on some particular solution, and then provides an experimental evaluation with a discussion. We start by commenting on why we think the most important tracker, \gls{siammot}, was chosen as a base for our experimentation, and then proceed to a general description of this approach (\sectiontext{}~\ref{sec:SiamMOT}). Subsequently, we propose our first enhancement to this tracker based on top of external neural network used for object \gls{reid} (\sectiontext{}~\ref{sec:SiamMOTandReID}). In the next section, we describe our experiments aimed at combining learning metric embeddings with the \gls{siammot} tracker (\sectiontext{}~\ref{sec:SiamMOTandFeatureEmb}). We continue by examining the inclusion of the attention mechanism and a deformable convolution operation into the end-to-end \gls{siammot} model (\sectiontext{}~\ref{sec:SiamMOTandAttention}). We finish off with an overall discussion of our Siamese-related experiments (\sectiontext{}~\ref{sec:ExperimentsDisucssion}).
