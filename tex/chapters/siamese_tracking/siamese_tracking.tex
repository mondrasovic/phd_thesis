\chapter{Developed Approaches to Visual Object Tracking}
\label{chap:DevelopedVisualTrackingApproaches}

In this chapter, we dive into our contributions to the field of Siamese-based \gls{vot}. This entire chapter follows a specific pattern. It consists of five sections in total, and every section begins with motivation, then elaborates on some particular solution, and finishes off by providing experimental evaluation followed by a discussion. We start with a general description of a so-called \gls{siammot} tracker (\sectiontext{}~\ref{sec:SiamMOT}). After that, we comment on why we think this model is suitable for traffic analysis (\sectiontext{}~\ref{sec:SiamMOTTrafficAnalysis}). Then, we propose our first enhancement to the \gls{siammot} tracker based on top of external neural network aimed at object \gls{reid} (\sectiontext{}~\ref{sec:SiamMOTandReID}). In the next section, we describe our experiments where we tried to incorporate learning metric embeddings into the end-to-end training pipeline of the \gls{siammot} tracker itself (\sectiontext{}~\ref{sec:SiamMOTandFeatureEmb}). We close the chapter by examining the inclusion of attention mechanism and a deformable convolution operation, once again, by altering the end-to-end tracking pipeline of the \gls{siammot} tracker (\sectiontext{}~\ref{sec:SiamMOTandAttention}).
