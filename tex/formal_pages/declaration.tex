I sincerely declare that the thesis \textit{Visual Object Tracking} has been composed solely by myself and that it has not been submitted, in whole or in part, in any previous application for a degree. Except for the cases where stated otherwise, either by reference or an acknowledgment, the work presented is entirely my own created under the guidance of the aforementioned supervisors.
