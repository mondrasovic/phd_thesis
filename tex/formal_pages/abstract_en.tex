The growing availability of video recording devices has produced an upsurge in interest to analyze video streams. The field of computer vision studies diverse tasks. Among them, the task of visual object tracking is one of the most challenging. Another quickly expanding area with significant influence over the computer vision is machine learning, especially deep machine learning. In this work, we disseminate our results concerning research of visual object tracking using deep machine learning tools. We provide a survey of various approaches to tracking, supported by the architectural details of those solutions. A key difficulty in tracking objects is object occlusion, which we have selected as the problem we will focus on in the future. Besides tracking, our report also includes another two equally relevant areas: similarity learning and re-identification. The former is known within the tracking community as Siamese neural networks, for which we give an extensive elaboration. Along with this, an application of similarity learning to object re-identification is also discussed. Since solutions to problems caused by object occlusion may be coupled with motion prediction in the absence of visual input, we, therefore, provide an analysis of this area as well. Taking advantage of deep machine learning requires a large amount of data for model training and evaluation. With this in mind, we also provide a short description of available datasets that we have utilized so far or just plan to use later on. Our contention is, as supported by the recent publications, that adopting fully convolutional neural network architectures for visual object tracking supported by the methods of object re-identification based on similarity learning could yield practically applicable results. This idea is enunciated further in the last chapter by the principal objectives of the dissertation thesis for which this work is a preliminary write-up of the progress to date.
